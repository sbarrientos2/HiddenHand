# HiddenHand

## The Pitch

**Tagline:** *"The only poker game where the house can't see your cards."*

---

### THE HOOK

"In online poker, the house always sees your cards. Until now."

---

### THE PROBLEM

Every year, **$60 billion** flows through online poker.

And every hand you play, you're making a bet that has nothing to do with your cards. You're betting that the platform won't cheat. That their employees won't peek. That their servers won't get hacked.

In 2007, insiders at Ultimate Bet could see every player's hole cards. They stole **millions** before anyone noticed.

The dirty secret of online poker? **The game is only as honest as the people running it.**

You're not playing poker. You're playing *trust*.

---

### THE BREAKTHROUGH

**HiddenHand is the first poker game where no one can see your cards. Not even us.**

Built on Solana with Inco Lightning's confidential computing, your hole cards are encrypted the moment they're dealt. The blockchain enforces the rules. Cryptography keeps your hand private.

- No server that sees all cards
- No database to hack
- No superuser exploits
- No "trust us"

**Just math.**

### HOW IT WORKS

When you sit down at a HiddenHand table:

1. Cards are shuffled using **cryptographic randomness** inside a secure enclave
2. Your hole cards are encrypted to **your key only**
3. The game state lives on Solana - transparent, immutable, auditable
4. At showdown, cards are revealed through **zero-knowledge proofs**

The result? A poker game that's **provably fair by design**, not by promise.

### WHY THIS MATTERS

This isn't just better poker. This is **the only architecture for truly decentralized poker.**

Without cryptographic privacy, someone always controls the deck. A server. An operator. A single point of trust - and failure.

HiddenHand eliminates that point entirely.

**For the first time in history, you can play poker with strangers anywhere in the world, for any stakes, with zero counterparty risk.**

No house. No trust. Just cards.

---

### THE VISION

Poker is just the beginning.

Any game with hidden information - blackjack, battleship, trading card games - has the same trust problem. HiddenHand's architecture is the blueprint for **an entire generation of trustless gaming**.

We're not building a poker app. We're building the foundation for **fair games on the internet**.

---

### THE ASK

HiddenHand is live on Solana devnet. The core game engine is complete. Encrypted card dealing is integrated with Inco Lightning.

We're proving that **privacy isn't just a feature - it's the unlock.**

**The house always sees your cards?**

**Not anymore.**

*HiddenHand. Poker you can verify.*
